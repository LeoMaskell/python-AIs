## purpose
- the orogional idea was to predict heart attacks - see the dataset.csv
- I wanted to use this idea to learn to make Neural Networks (NNs)
- taking the following into consideration, i would say its a pretty good try:
    - I'm 14
    - I'm using an ipad and a raspberry pi
    - I'm new to all of the maths etc.
## programs
### number 1
- ai1.py
- the origional idea was not to use any libraries other than numpy
